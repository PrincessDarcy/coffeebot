<p>CoffeeBot is my first real solo project, which began on March 3rd, 2016.  The idea behind the project was to initially get myself situated and comfortable with the language and the API I was working with, but it expanded way beyond that!</p>
<p>CoffeeBot is a pseudo-AI coded in C# .NET using an unofficial <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a> API called <a href="https://github.com/420foxbot/Discord.Net">Discord.Net</a>.  Discord is a text and voice client, similar to Skype or Teamspeak.  The product is still in development but is showing very promising results with what it is currently capable of.  I also have an interface that allows me to use CoffeeBot commands outside of servers where she is located.  At this point in time, CoffeeBot consists of over 1,900 lines of code.  Before anyone asks, I will not under ANY circumstances release any source code for this project.</p>
<p>CoffeeBot is currently launched and maintained on 3 servers, with a user count ranging from 12 to over 150 users.  She is equipped with numerous commands and featured listed on the right, with more features added weekly!</p>
<p>Features currently slated for development include youtube audio streaming capabilities, a comprehensive language filter with a toggle option for specific channels, and the ability to change certain server settings based on role levels.</p>
<h3>Features!</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Some interaction messages.  Sometimes CoffeeBot will react to certain things you say</p></li>
<li><p>Extensive tag filtering system, and the ability to toggle channels SFW/NSFW</p></li>
<li><p>All chat channels are logged, including timestamps</p></li>
<li><p>Specialized greeting messages for new users joining the server</p></li>
</ul>
